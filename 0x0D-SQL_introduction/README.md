Project: Learning Objectives

In this project, you will learn key concepts related to databases and gain practical knowledge of working with a relational database management system (RDBMS) called MySQL. By the end of this project, you will be able to explain the following topics without relying on external resources:
General

    What's a database: Understand the concept of a database as a structured collection of data that is organized, stored, and managed for efficient retrieval and manipulation.

    What's a relational database: Comprehend the concept of a relational database, which organizes data into tables, establishes relationships between tables, and uses the relational model to ensure data integrity and flexibility.

    What does SQL stand for: Discover that SQL stands for Structured Query Language, a standardized programming language used for managing relational databases.

    What's MySQL: Gain familiarity with MySQL, an open-source RDBMS widely used for its speed, reliability, and ease of use.

    How to create a database in MySQL: Learn the process of creating a database in MySQL using SQL commands and understand the importance of defining the database schema.

    What does DDL and DML stand for: Differentiate between Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML). Understand that DDL includes commands like CREATE, ALTER, and DROP, used to define or modify database objects, while DML includes commands like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE, used to manipulate data within the database.

    How to CREATE or ALTER a table: Explore the syntax and usage of SQL commands to create and modify database tables. Learn how to define columns, specify data types, set constraints, and establish relationships between tables.

    How to SELECT data from a table: Understand the SELECT statement in SQL and its various clauses to retrieve specific data from one or more tables. Learn about filtering data using conditions, sorting results, and limiting the number of rows returned.

    How to INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE data: Grasp the SQL commands for inserting new records into a table, updating existing records, and deleting records based on specific criteria.

    What are subqueries: Gain an understanding of subqueries as nested queries within another query. Learn how to use subqueries to perform advanced data retrieval and manipulation operations.

    How to use MySQL functions: Explore the built-in functions provided by MySQL to perform various operations on data, such as mathematical calculations, string manipulation, date and time operations, and aggregate functions for data summarization.

Feel free to dive into the project and enhance your knowledge and practical skills in working with databases and MySQL.
